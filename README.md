# Focused Controller: Bringing Real OOP to Rails Controllers #

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jonleighton/focused_controller.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jonleighton/focused_controller)


## Description ##

Classical Rails controllers violate the Single Responsibility Principle.

Each different "action" has separate responsibilities: A `create`
action does something entirely different to a `destroy` action, yet
they end up lumped into the same object.

This has two unfortunate side effects:

1. *We end up using instance variables to share data with our views when
   we should really be using methods*. Using instance variables for this
   purpose breaks encapsulation and can lead to subtle bugs. For example,
   an undeclared instance variable in a view will be nil, rather than
   raising an error when referenced.

2. *We misuse before_filters to share functionality between actions*.
   Instead of using proper OO patterns like inheritance and mixins to keep
   our code DRY, we shoe-horn `before_filter` with `:only` or `:except` to
   share chunks of code between specific actions.

A related problem with controllers is that the way we test them is slow
and esoteric. Rather than calling a single method on our controller
object and making assertions about what happened, we generate a request
to put through the full controller stack, exercising large amounts of
internal Rails code in each test case. These are not unit tests, yet
they are often used to test logic.

Focused Controller aims to address these issues by using a single, focused
object for each action. These object should have only one responsibility
and be straightforward to instantiate and test in isolation.

## Feedback needed ##

This project is in early stages, and while I have been using it
successfully on a production application, I'm very keen for others to
start experimenting with it and providing feedback.

Note that I will follow SemVer, and the project is currently pre-1.0, so
there could be API changes. However if the user base grows significantly,
then I will try to avoid painful changes.

There is a [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/focused_controller)
for discussion.

## Usage ##

Focused Controller changes Rails' conventions. Rather than controllers
being classes that contain one method per action, controllers are now
namespaces and each action is a class within that namespace.

Controllers which wish to use this convention include the
`FocusedController::Mixin` module. This means you can start using
Focused Controller in an existing project without having to rewrite all
your existing controller code.

An example:

``` ruby
module PostsController
  # Action is a common superclass for all the actions
  # inside `PostsController`.
  class Action < ApplicationController
    include FocusedController::Mixin
  end

  class Index < Action
    def run
      # Your code here.
    end

    # No instance variables are shared with the view. Instead,
    # public methods are defined.
    def posts
      @posts ||= Post.all
    end

    # To prevent yourself having to write `controller.posts`
    # in the view, you can declare the method as a helper
    # method which means that calling `posts` automatically
    # delegates to the controller.
    helper_method :posts
  end

  # Actions do not need to declare a `run` method - the default
  # implementation inherited from `FocusedController::Mixin` is an
  # empty method.
  class Show < Action
    # Here's a shorter way to declare a method that is also a
    # helper_method
    expose(:post) { Post.find params[:id] }

    # You can also call expose without a block, in which case an
    # attr_reader and a helper_method are declared
    expose :first_comment
  end
end
```

## Routing ##

Rails' normal routing assumes your actions are methods inside an object
whose name ends with 'controller'. For example:

``` ruby
get '/posts/new' => 'posts#new'
```

will route `GET /posts/new` to `PostsController#new`.

To get around this, we use the `focused_controller_routes` helper:

``` ruby
MyCool::Appliation.routes.draw do
  focused_controller_routes do
    get '/posts/new' => 'posts#new'
  end
end
```

The route will now map to `PostsController::New#run`.

This is similar to writing:

``` ruby
get '/posts/new' => proc { |env| PostsController::New.call(env) }
```

All the normal routing macros are also supported:

``` ruby
focused_controller_routes do
  resources :posts
end
```

## Functional Testing ##

Though it's not encouraged, focused controllers can be tested in the
classical 'functional' style. This can be a useful interim measure when
converting a controller to be properly unit tested.

It no longer makes sense to specify the action name to be called as the
action name is always "run". So this is omitted:

``` ruby
module UsersController
  class CreateTest < ActionController::TestCase
    include FocusedController::FunctionalTestHelper

    test "should create user" do
      assert_difference('User.count') do
        post user: { name: 'Jon' }
      end

      assert_redirected_to user_path(@controller.user)
    end
  end
end
```

There is also an equivalent helper for RSpec:

``` ruby
describe UsersController do
  include FocusedController::RSpecFunctionalHelper

  describe UsersController::Create do
    it "should create user" do
      expect { post user: { name: 'Jon' } }.to change(User, :count).by(1)
      response.should redirect_to(user_path(subject.user))
    end
  end
end
```

Don't forget to add the line below to your spec_helper.rb file:

``` ruby
require 'focused_controller/rspec_functional_helper'
```

## Unit Testing ##

A better way to test your controllers is with unit tests. This involves
creating an instance of your action class and calling methods on it. For
example, to test that your `user` method finds the correct user, you
might write:

``` ruby
module UsersController
  class ShowTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
    test 'finds the user' do
      user = User.create

      controller = UsersController::Show.new
      controller.params = { id: user.id }

      assert_equal user, controller.user
    end
  end
end
```

### The `#run` method ###

Testing the code in your `#run` method is a little more involved,
depending on what's in it. For example, your `#run` method may use
(explicitly or implicitly) any of the following objects:

* request
* response
* params
* session
* flash
* cookies

To make the experience smoother, Focused Controller sets up mock
versions of these objects, much like with classical functional testing.
It also provides accessors for these objects in your test class.

The fact that we have to do this is an indication of high coupling
between the controller and these other objects. In the future, I want to
look at ways to reduce this coupling and make testing more straightforward
and obvious.

In the mean time, here is an example:

``` ruby
module UsersController
  class CreateTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
    include FocusedController::TestHelper

    test "should create user" do
      assert_difference('User.count') do
        req user: { name: 'Jon' }
      end

      assert_redirected_to user_path(controller.user)
    end
  end
end
```

### The `req` helper ###

The `req` method runs the "request", but it does *not* go through the
Rack stack. It simply sets up the params, session, flash, and then calls
the `#run` method. The following are equivalent:

``` ruby
req({ x: 'x' }, { y: 'y' }, { z: 'z' })
```

``` ruby
controller.params = { x: 'x' }
session.update(y: 'y')
flash.update(z: 'z')
controller.run
```

### Assertions ###

You also have access to the normal assertions found in Rails' functional
tests:

* `assert_template`
* `assert_response`
* `assert_redirected_to`

However, I intend to consider alternatives to these. For example,

``` ruby
assert_equal users_path, controller.location
```

seems lot more straightforward and explicit to me than:

``` ruby
assert_redirected_to users_path
```

### Filters ###

We're not testing through the Rack stack. We're just calling the `#run`
method. Therefore, filters do not get run. This is a feature: if your
filter code is truly orthogonal to your controller code it should be
unit tested separately. If it is not orthogonal then you should find a
way to invoke it more explicitly than via filters.

(At this point I will ask: if it is truly orthogonal, why not make it a
Rack middleware?)

### RSpec ###

There is a helper for RSpec as well:

``` ruby
describe UsersController do
  include FocusedController::RSpecHelper

  describe UsersController::Create do
    test "should create user" do
      expect { req user: { name: 'Jon' } }.to change(User, :count).by(1)
      response.should redirect_to(user_path(subject.user))
    end
  end
end
```

Don't forget to add the line below to your spec_helper.rb file:

``` ruby
require 'focused_controller/rspec_helper'
```

## Isolated unit tests ##

It is possible to completely decouple your focused controller tests from
the Rails application. This means you don't have to pay the penalty of
starting up Rails every time you want to run a test. The benefit this
brings will depend on how coupled your controllers/tests are to other
dependencies.

Your `config/routes.rb` file is a dependency. When you use a URL helper
you are depending on that file. As this is a common dependency, Focused
Controller provides a way to stub out URL helpers:

``` ruby
module UsersController
  class CreateTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
    include FocusedController::TestHelper
    stub_url :user

    # ...
  end
end
```

The `stub_url` declaration will make the `user_path` and `user_url`
methods in your test and your controller return stub objects. These can
be compared, so `user_path(user1) == user_path(user1)`, but
`user_path(user1) != user_path(user2)`.

## Speed comparison ##

Here's a comparison of running the same test in each of the different
styles:

### Functional ###

* **Test time**: 0.154842s, 45.2075 tests/s, 64.5821 assertions/s
* **Total time**: 3.380s

### Unit ###

* **Test time**: 0.046101s, 151.8393 tests/s, 216.9133 assertions/s
* **Total time**: 3.578s

### Isolated Unit ###

* **Test time**: 0.016669s, 419.9434 tests/s, 599.9191 assertions/s
* **Total time**: 2.398s

## More examples ##

The [acceptance
tests](https://github.com/jonleighton/focused_controller/tree/master/test/acceptance)
for Focused Controller exercise a [complete Rails
application](https://github.com/jonleighton/focused_controller/tree/master/test/app),
which uses the plugin. Therefore, you might wish to look there to get
more of an idea about how it can be used.

(Note that the code there is based on Rails' scaffolding, not how I
would typically write controllers and tests, necessarily.)
